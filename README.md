## 🎯 Difficulty Levels  
To help contributors pick tasks, we use these labels:

| Label         | Meaning                              |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `easy`        | Simple task — one quick commit        |
| `medium`      | Moderate complexity — needs some work |
| `hard`        | Big / complex task — more effort      |

## 🛠 How to use labels  
1. Go to **Issues** tab.  
2. Create labels:  
   - `easy` — Small/simple stuff  
   - `medium` — Medium difficulty  
   - `hard` — Requires more effort  
3. When creating or handling an issue, assign one of these labels.  
4. Contributors can filter by label:  
   - [easy](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/labels/easy)  
   - [medium](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/labels/medium)  
   - [hard](https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO/labels/hard)
